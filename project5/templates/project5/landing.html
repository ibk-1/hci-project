  <p class="mb-1">
    This tool demonstrates <strong>Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)</strong> using a toy mouse-and-cheese world.
  </p>
  <ul class="mb-1">
    <li>You will see two possible <strong>trajectories</strong> (A and B) of a mouse moving through a grid with walls, traps, normal cheese, and organic cheese.</li>
    <li>Each trajectory has a <strong>return score</strong> (how well the mouse performed).</li>
    <li>Your task is to <strong>pick the better trajectory</strong> by clicking <em>Prefer A</em> or <em>Prefer B</em>.  
        For example, prefer the one with fewer traps or better cheese.</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Load New Pair</strong> to see another set of trajectories and continue labeling.</li>
    <li>After collecting enough preferences, go to the <strong>Trainer</strong> page (via the top menu) to:
      <ul>
        <li>Train a baseline policy (REINFORCE)</li>
        <li>Train a reward model from your labels</li>
        <li>Fine-tune the policy with RLHF</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>This shows how human feedback (your choices) can guide a reinforcement learning agent to improve over time.</li>
  </ul>

    <p class="text-secondary small mb-0">
      This app trains a mouse to find cheese. We learn a policy with REINFORCE (Task 1), then
      refine it with human preferences using a Bradley–Terry reward model and a KL penalty (Tasks 2–3).
